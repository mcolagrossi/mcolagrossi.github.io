Executive Summary
======

Europeans are, on average, better educated
and live healthier, longer and more prosperous
lives today than at any point in the past.
However, this view on average achievements
obscures large disparities, both within and
between European countries. The income of
the richest 20% of households in Europe is
on average 5 times higher than that of the poorest
20%, and up to 8 times higher in some Member
States. Most indicators of well-being display
a social gradient according to education level,
occupation, income and social status.
The Great Recession has reinforced existing
socio-economic divides. Vulnerable groups
– those with low education levels, the unemployed
and individuals with a migrant experience – have
largely borne the brunt of the resulting economic
downturn and austerity programmes. Southern
European countries were hit particularly hard.
Growing disparities on multiple socio-economic
dimensions have contributed to a sense
of unfairness and discontent in Europe. Recent
data show that 38% of Europeans do not believe
that they are treated fairly and 41% do not agree
that they have enjoyed equal opportunities in
life. Fairness is a subjective phenomenon, but
the far-reaching consequences of perceptions of
unfairness warrant a closer look at its drivers and
underlying dynamics. The present report analyses
some of the most pertinent dimensions of fairness
in relation to the agenda for a fair, inclusive and
social European Union.
