I am currently a researcher at the [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.ucsc.it/), [Department of International Economics, Institutions and Development](https://dipartimenti.unicatt.it/diseis-home?rdeLocaleAttr=en).

I earned an MSc in Economics from [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/) (UvT) and a PhD at the [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.ucsc.it/) (UCSC), Department of International Economics, Institutions and Development, where I worked as a researcher. Prior to joining the [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.ucsc.it/), I was an economist for 6+ years at the European Commission [Joint Research Centre](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en) (JRC), Monitoring, Indicators and Impact Evaluation Unit.

My research interests include labor economics, political economy and microeconometrics methods.
